      <description>Education and Background I grew up in Fresno California after my father and mother relocated from there 6 figure jobs in San Fransisco. Now my dad was a teacher and my mom stayed at home, so although we had a reserve of funds, we attempted to live more paycheck to paycheck in order to save that money for education. I was raised on strong morales to be a leader and let my voice be heard, with my parents pressuring me (although now I thank them for it) into playing usually 4-5 sports in one year.</description>

      <description>Interest in Computer Science My interest in computers really all stemmed from me being the first of my family to be technologically savvy. I was the first one to want a portable computer and I was the first one to want a gaming console. This created a interesting dynamic of I was called upon to answer any tech problem, and I liked being asked for help from, so I desired to know more about computer based machines so I could get that positive feedback loop.</description>

      <description>My Hobbies and Interest I have a deep love for video games in any form other than Call of Duty, enjoying more competitive games slightly more, such as League of Legends and Valorant. But I don&amp;rsquo;t let my borderline obsession with video games take over my life. I work out most days of the week, only really taking off the weekends, where me and my family will go on hikes to compensate for our lack of motivaiton to go to the gym.</description>
