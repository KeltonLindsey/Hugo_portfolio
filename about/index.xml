      <description>View Resume
Education and Background I grew up in Fresno California after my father and mother relocated from there 6 figure jobs in San Fransisco. Now my dad was a teacher and my mom stayed at home, so although we had a reserve of funds, we attempted to live more paycheck to paycheck in order to save that money for education. I was raised on strong morales to be a leader and let my voice be heard, with my parents pressuring me (although now I thank them for it) into playing usually 4-5 sports in one year.</description>
